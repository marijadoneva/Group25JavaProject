Ex:  int[] arr = {99, 12, 23, 32, 44, 57, 6} ==> 6

Array_SortAscending
Write a return method that can sort an int array in Ascending order without using the sort method of the Arrays class

arr = sortAscending(arr); ==>{ 7, 8, 9, 10};

 Array_SortDescending
Write a return method that can sort an int array in descending order without using the sort method of the Arrays class
