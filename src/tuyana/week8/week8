Array - N unique integers that sum up to 0
Write a function that given an integer N (1 < N < 100), returns an array
containing N unique integers that sum up to 0. The function can return any
such array.
For example, given N = 4, the function could return [1,0, -3,2] or [-2,1, -4,5].
The answer [1, - 1,1,3] would be incorrect (because value 1 occurs twice).
For N = 3 one of the possible answers is [-1,0,1] (but there are many more
correct answers).

0]
